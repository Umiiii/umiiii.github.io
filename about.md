Umi has been coding and putting his own money into investments since he was 18. 

Surprisingly, he has not lost all his money, and in fact made more.

So far, he has written many programs that function as intended, and twice as many that do not. And he shows no sign of slowing down.

Umi remains as youthful, as lively, and as lovable as ever, and grows more handsome with each year.

You can be sure of that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious.
